# BookStack
## Keep Track of your book library!
### Version number 1.0.0

BookStack is a custom Full-Stack web app that I programmed from the ground up as a portfolio project.

Users and books are stored in a MYSQL database, which is returned to an API with PHP. React then dynamically access this API to implement basic CRUD operations.

More Info coming soon
